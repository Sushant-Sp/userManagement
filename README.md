# **Spring Boot User Management System**

## **Objective**

The purpose of this task is to evaluate your Spring Boot skills, particularly in building RESTful APIs, implementing role-based access control (RBAC), and integrating token-based authentication. Additionally, this task will assess your ability to handle real-world scenarios such as entity relationships, error handling, and database interactions.

## **Task Details**

### **1. Set Up a Spring Boot Application**
To begin, you need to create a Spring Boot project that includes the following dependencies:

- **Spring Web** - For creating the RESTful APIs.
- **Spring Data JPA** - For interacting with the database.
- **Spring Security** - For securing the APIs.
- **JWT** (JSON Web Token) - For token-based authentication.
- **H2 Database** (or any lightweight database for testing) - To store user and role data.

You can initialize the project using [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/) or by using your IDE's built-in Spring Boot project setup tool.

### **2. Implement User and Role Management**

Create the following entities in the application:

#### **User Entity:**
- **Fields:**
  - `id`: Unique identifier (Primary Key).
  - `name`: The name of the user.
  - `email`: User email (ensure it is unique).
  - `password`: Encrypted password (use BCrypt for encryption).
  - `roles`: List of roles associated with the user.

#### **Role Entity:**
- **Fields:**
  - `id`: Unique identifier (Primary Key).
  - `name`: Name of the role (e.g., Admin, Manager, User).

**Requirements:**
- A user can have multiple roles.
- Passwords should be securely hashed using BCrypt.
- Users and roles should have a many-to-many relationship.

---

### **3. Create APIs with Role-Based Access Control**

The following APIs should be implemented with role-based access control:

#### **Admin APIs** (accessible only to users with the Admin role):
- **Create User:** POST /api/users
- **Read User:** GET /api/users/{id}
- **Update User:** PUT /api/users/{id}
- **Delete User:** DELETE /api/users/{id}
- **Assign Roles:** PUT /api/users/{id}/roles

#### **Manager APIs** (accessible only to users with the Manager role):
- **View Users:** GET /api/users
- **Assign Tasks to Users:** PUT /api/users/{id}/tasks

#### **User APIs** (accessible to all authenticated users):
- **View Profile:** GET /api/users/me
- **View Assigned Tasks:** GET /api/users/me/tasks

---

### **4. Secure APIs with JWT Authentication**

#### **JWT Authentication:**
- Implement JWT-based authentication to secure all APIs.
- Ensure that:
  - Admin APIs are accessible only to users with the Admin role.
  - Manager APIs are accessible only to users with the Manager role.
  - User APIs are accessible to all authenticated users.

**JWT Flow:**
1. Users will log in via a login API that accepts email and password.
2. After successful authentication, a JWT token will be issued and returned to the client.
3. The client will send the token in the `Authorization` header of subsequent API requests (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`).
4. The server will validate the JWT for each API call.

---

### **5. Implement Database Integration**

Use a relational database (e.g., H2 for testing) to persist user and role data. The database should have at least two tables:
- `users`: To store user data.
- `roles`: To store role information.
- `user_roles`: A many-to-many relationship table for users and roles.

**Pre-populate the database with sample data**:
- Example Roles: Admin, Manager, User.
- Example Users: A few users assigned to different roles.

You can use SQL scripts to insert some sample data when the application starts.

---

### **6. Error Handling and Validation**

Implement error handling for the following scenarios:

#### **Common Errors:**
- **Duplicate Users:** Return an appropriate error message when attempting to create a user with an email that already exists.
- **Invalid or Expired JWT Tokens:** Return a 401 Unauthorized response when the token is invalid or expired.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Return a 403 Forbidden response when a user tries to access an API that requires a higher level of permission.

#### **Input Validation:**
- **Email Format:** Validate that the email is in a correct format.
- **Password Strength:** Ensure that the password is sufficiently strong (e.g., minimum 8 characters, contains at least one number and one special character).

### **How to Run the Application**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-management-system.git
   cd user-management-system
   ```

2. **Set up Database**:
   The application uses H2 Database for testing. You can change the configuration in `application.properties` if you want to use another database.

3. **Run the Application**:
   If you are using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   If you are using Gradle:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

4. **Test the APIs**:
   You can use Postman, cURL, or any HTTP client to test the APIs.
   Example request to authenticate and get a JWT:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login -d '{"email": "user@example.com", "password": "password123"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json"
   ```

5. **Access the APIs**:
   - For Admin:
     ```bash
     curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/users -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>"
     ```
   - For Manager:
     ```bash
     curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/users -H "Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>"
     ```

6. **Validate Error Handling**:
   - Test scenarios like invalid JWT, duplicate users, and unauthorized access to restricted APIs to ensure that the error handling works properly.

### **Technologies Used**

- **Spring Boot** for the application framework.
- **Spring Security** for securing the APIs.
- **JWT** for token-based authentication.
- **Spring Data JPA** for database interaction.
- **H2 Database** for lightweight testing (or any other relational database).
- **BCrypt** for securely hashing passwords.

---

### **Conclusion**

This project provides a comprehensive demonstration of a Spring Boot-based user management system with secure, role-based access control and JWT authentication. By completing this task, you will have practiced core Spring Boot skills such as REST API development, user authentication, role-based access control, and error handling.
